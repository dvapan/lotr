This is my take in the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off">Github Game Off 2012 contest</a>. Without any ambition, though :)

# Computer Alchemy

This game is an attempt at porting the iPhone/Android game **Alchemy** to Javascript, completely playable on the client side so eventually it'll run on a **Github** page.

## Game concept

You start with basic elements. You can **clone** elements and **merge** them to create new ones, and so on.

## Current state / Changelog / TODO

Initial POC live at http://ozh.github.com/alchemy/

### Game ideas

- _Elements_ will be __computer related elements__, combined to create new ones (example: __Python + Perl = Ruby__). Nothing random, just semi documented stuff (Wikipedia FTW if unsure)

- **Coffee** will be a special element, available from start, used to improve on existing elements when no real combo is available (example: **Fortran + Coffee = Algol**) (yeah, I didn't know about Algol either, yet it's been part of the root of many things)

- Every [interval or event to be determined] a __popular character__ will be introduced and available as an element, allowing for new combos (example: __IBM + Bill Gates = MS DOS__)

- This needs badges. People love badges. With a "tweet that badge" button. People love tweet buttons.

- Tips in the notification box

- Make use of <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>. It's awesome.

### Needs

- Ideas for dozens of mixable elements. I think the game will start being interesting around 250 elements.

- Sexy 32x32 icons for every element. Doh.
